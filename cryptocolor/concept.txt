Idea for encoding integer values onto colors that are distiguishable by the human eye.
black = 0
white = 1
green = 2
blue  = 3
purple= 4
red   = 5
orange= 6
yellow= 7

with the basic color wheel ( yellow orange red purple blue green (plus base values white and blue))
we can represent 8 values

if it's possible to bring the number of values to 16, we can represent any ascci char whith just 2
colors
                                                0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9  10 11 12 13 15 15
ideas: introduce new colors between each value: y _ o _ r _ p _ u _  g  _  w  _  b  _
                                                1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16
                                                  br  pn  pl  lv  tl    ol    gr    gr+

Also, there is the possibility of combining colors with symbols to make more possibilities.

GOAL:
to be able to make paintings that encode written text exclusively through color.
